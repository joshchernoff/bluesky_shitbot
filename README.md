# BlueSkyðŸ¦‹ ShitðŸ’© BotðŸ¤–

I wanted to start to use BlueSky but found that a large portion of users that are following me are not real and dishonest.
A common trait is their following count is large and typically in the thosands, and their average post/follower counts are less than 10.
They are likely farming your content, trying to promote something, or have other malicious intent.

My goal is to watch the create a bot that observs the Bluesky stream (ie firehose/jetstream) to see who is following people in mass such as these bots.
Then I will add these users to a list to make it easy to block them all.
