# BlueSkyðŸ¦‹ ShitðŸ’© BotðŸ¤–

I wanted to join BlueSky but found that a large portion of users that are following me are not real and dishonest.

A common trait is they are following disproportionately to that of people following them back. On average I noticed that a Following to Followers ratio of 1% i.e. 100:1 is a common factor. 

Sadly bluesky has a concept of starter packs where new users can mass follow many people all at once. Some of these starter packs have users that you can mass follow in the 200+ range.   
These users commonly get flagged as false positives because they are typically new users who are just following a bunch of people.   

At the moment I only check the ratio given a user is following more than 200+ accounts.    
Though this may change in the future. 

The other metric I look at is a following to post count of 0.1% or 1000:1.
Given a user is following more than 1k+ accounts but only has 1 post this too is a common flag for bots.   
In rare cases Iâ€™ve seen false positives of users follow 1k+ users but only have 1 post, it's possible but rare.    

The issue with flagging bots after they follow 1k+ users is that the damage is already done.
